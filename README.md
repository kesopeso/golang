# GO programming journey

This repository is meant as a playground for me to learn go programming. Each folder contains some code I've written while reading a book that belongs to that folder. I will also be leaving some comments and notes along the way, just so I have a reference point for the things I've learned along the way. Maybe I'll even update this README file, so I can navigate to things I'm looking for quicker.

Anyway, let the go journey begin :)
